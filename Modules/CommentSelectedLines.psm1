    .SYNOPSIS
    Exands the selected text to make sure the entire lines are selected.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Exands the selected text to make sure the entire lines are selected.

    .PARAMETER DoNothingWhenNotCertainOfWhichLinesToSelect
    Under the following edge case we can't determine for sure which lines in the file are selected.
    If this switch is not provided and the edge case is encountered, we will guess and attempt to select the entire selected lines, but we may guess wrong and select the lines above/below the selected lines.
    If this switch is provided and the edge case is encountered, no lines will be selected.

    Edge Case:
    - When the selected text occurs multiple times in the document, directly above or below the selected text.

    Example:
    abc
    abc
    abc

    - If only the first two lines are selected, when you run this command it may comment out the 1st and 2nd lines correctly, or it may comment out the 2nd and 3rd lines, depending on
    if the caret is on the 1st line or 2nd line when selecting the text (i.e. the text is selected bottom-to-top vs. top-to-bottom).
    - Since the lines are typically identical for this edge case to occur, you likely won't really care which 2 of the 3 lines get selected, so it shouldn't be a big deal.
    But if it bugs you, you can provide this switch.

    .OUTPUT
    PSObject. Returns a PSObject with the properties FirstLineNumber and LastLineNumber, which correspond to the first and last line numbers of the selected text.
