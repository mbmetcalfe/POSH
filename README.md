# POSH

A simple repository for PowerShell scripts I use daily and update as needed.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Microsft PowerShell.  I would recommend at least version 3.0.  To check what version you have, open up PowerShell and type this command:


```
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

You will see a table like this:
```
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
3      0      -1     -1
```

### Installing

Download the scripts to your machine.  Some of the scripts will require the correct path to be set.

For example, in profile.ps1:
```
$ScriptRootPath = "c:\dev\POSH"
```
